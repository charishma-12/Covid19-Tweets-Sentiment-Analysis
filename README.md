This project is implemented to predict the sentiments of Twitter tweets regarding Covid19. The respective dataset used in the project contains the tweets with the hashtag covid and respective sentiment along with other data like location, time, screen name, etc. So, this model is trained with the dataset, to classify a covid tweet as one among positive, negative, extremely positive, extremely negative, or neutral. The prediction of tweets sentiment happens with the classification algorithms used, i.e Logistic Regression
